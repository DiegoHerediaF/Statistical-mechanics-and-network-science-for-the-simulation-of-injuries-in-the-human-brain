## Highlights

Using diffusion, structural and functional magnetic resonance data from the HCP data set for health young adult, we build network models in which nodes are brain regions and edges are anatomical connections and correlations in metabolic activity. 

We simulated correlation in metabolic activity with a statistical mechanics model of discrete states on a network, in which the interactions between nodes are linear and their intrinsic activity is simulated as stochastic activity, which is modeled as coming from a thermal bath; this results in ising-like models, in other words the Generalized Ising Model. The best fit of this model was given at the edge of criticality.

It was quantified integration and segregation with centrality and clustering topological measures, then we selected six regions for attack.


## Abstract
Using diffusion, structural and functional magnetic resonance data from the HCP data set for health young adult, we build network models in which nodes are brain regions and edges are anatomical connections and correlations in metabolic activity. Then we simulated correlation in metabolic activity with a statistical mechanics model of discrete states on the anatomical network, in which the interactions between nodes are proportional to the number of anatomical connections and their intrinsic activity is simulated as stochastic activity, which is modeled as coming from a thermal bath; this results in ising-like models, in other words the Generalized Ising Model. The best fit of this model with the metabolic activity of health resting human brain was given at the edge of criticality.
