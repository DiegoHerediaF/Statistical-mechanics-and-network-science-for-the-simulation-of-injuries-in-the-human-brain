# Statistical-mechanics-and-network-science-for-the-simulation-of-injuries-in-the-human-brain
This repository shows the project carried out for the course "Introduction to theoretical research". In this project we simulate human functional connectivity from structural connectivity and the generalized ising model. This simulation was used to quantify the change in correlations and diversity of dynamic states (measured by entropy) of an injured brain relative to a healthy one.
